### My understanding and problem breakdown

>I need to draw a relation (regression or someting else) between 'winner' & 'passing_rate' and 'looser' & 'passing_rate'.
>Then try to answer the ased questions

## Approach

>I possess No understanding of data and visulation, to first I go to youtube and learn some simple examples of data anylisis and then I approach the core question. Date 26-06-2024
>Make an algorithm and get it verified somehow.

## Project file organisation

 > problem-statement-Data-&-docs } has the assigment Pdf and data
 > LICENSE } has the license

### Questions

The passing rate is defined as the ratio between passes played by a team and passes received by a
player the same team. We want you to analyze whether a good passing rate has a positive influence on
the chance of winning a soccer game:

 Does the winner of a match have a higher passing rate than the loser? 

 Is the difference in the passing rate in games with a winner higher than the difference in games that ended in a draw?

**A)** Perform a detailed descriptive analysis of the data set. Use appropriate statistical measures to
describe it. Include at least one statistical graphic. The descriptive analysis should be aimed at
answering the two above questions.

**B)** For each of the two above questions, perform an appropriate statistical hypotheses test: Has the
winner of a game a higher passing rate than the loser? Is the expected difference in passing rate
in games that end in a draw different from the expected difference in passing rate in games with
a winner? Give reasons for your choice of test.
